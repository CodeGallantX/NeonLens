# Data Cleaning and Predictive Insights App

## Overview

This application helps companies clean and analyze their data, then generates insights and predictions to increase sales and productivity. It’s built using **Streamlit** for the interface, **Pandas** for data processing, and various pre-trained machine learning models for predictions. 

The app supports multiple file formats (CSV, Excel), performs data cleaning, runs exploratory data analysis (EDA), and provides actionable business recommendations based on predictive models.

## Features

- **Data Upload**: Upload company data (CSV, Excel) for analysis.
- **Automated Data Cleaning**: Automatically handle missing values, outliers, and data formatting.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize trends, summary statistics, and correlations.
- **Predictive Models**: Run pre-trained models to generate predictions for sales, customer segmentation, demand forecasting, etc.
- **Customizable Visualizations**: Select from multiple charts and tables to visualize business metrics.
- **Actionable Insights**: Get data-driven recommendations to improve productivity and sales.
- **Downloadable Reports**: Download cleaned datasets and predictions in various formats.

   streamlit run app.py
   ```


## How to Use

### 1. Upload Data
- On the homepage, upload your company data (CSV, Excel formats supported).
- You can preview the uploaded data in the table.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- After uploading the data, the app will automatically clean the dataset (remove missing values, handle outliers, convert data types, etc.).
- A cleaned version of the data will be shown, with an option to download it.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- View summary statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, and correlations.
- Customize the type of visualizations (bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps) for analyzing different aspects of the data.

### 4. Predictive Models
- Based on the type of business or data, select the appropriate model (e.g., Sales Forecasting, Customer Segmentation, Demand Prediction).
- The app will run the pre-trained model and generate predictions.
- Results will be displayed along with model evaluation metrics.

### 5. Insights and Recommendations
- Based on the analysis and predictions, the app will provide data-driven insights.
- Actionable recommendations will be generated to help improve business processes and sales.

### 6. Download Reports
- After the analysis and predictions, you can download the cleaned data or the prediction results in CSV format.
- Additionally, generate downloadable PDF reports summarizing the analysis and insights.

## App Architecture

### Frontend
- **Streamlit**: The web interface allows for uploading data, displaying visualizations, and interacting with the predictions.

### Backend (Logic)
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Using `pandas`, the app automatically handles missing values, outliers, and type conversions.
2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**:
   - The app computes summary statistics and generates visualizations to help explore key trends.
3. **Predictive Models**:
   - Pre-trained models are loaded to generate predictions based on company data.
4. **Insight Generation**:
   - Insights and recommendations are generated based on the data trends and model results.

### Flowchart:
> User Uploads Data → Data Cleaning → EDA → Predictive Modeling → Insights & Recommendations → Download Results

## Sample Use Case

1. A retail company uploads its **sales data**.
2. The app cleans the data and removes missing entries.
3. The user chooses to analyze **sales trends** and visualizes them with a **line chart**.
4. The app runs a **sales forecasting model** to predict future sales based on historical data.
5. Based on predictions, the app recommends adjusting inventory levels to meet future demand.
6. The user downloads a **CSV report** of the insights and cleaned data.

## Customization

To modify the app to suit your specific needs, follow these steps:

1. **Add New Predictive Models**:
   - Add custom models in the `models` directory.
   - Ensure they are trained and serialized (using `joblib` or `pickle`) for future use.

2. **Customize Visualizations**:
   - Add more charts and graphs by extending the EDA section in the `visualizations.py` file.

3. **Change Data Cleaning Rules**:
   - Modify the data-cleaning pipeline by editing the `cleaning.py` file to handle domain-specific data issues.

## Deployment

To deploy the app:

### 1. Streamlit Cloud
   - Create an account on [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) and link the GitHub repository.
   - Deploy the app directly from Streamlit Cloud for free.

### 2. Heroku
   - Install the Heroku CLI and log in.
   - Run the following commands:
     ```bash
     heroku create
     git push heroku main
     heroku open
     ```

### 3. Docker
   - Build the Docker image:
     ```bash
     docker build -t data-cleaning-app .
     ```
   - Run the Docker container:
     ```bash
     docker run -p 8501:8501 data-cleaning-app

## Future Enhancements

- **User Authentication**: Allow companies to log in and save their data/analysis securely.
- **Notifications**: Add email/SMS alerts based on model predictions (e.g., alerting about a drop in sales).
- **Model Tuning**: Allow users to upload their own models or fine-tune existing models.
- **More Data Formats**: Support for more file types (e.g., JSON, SQL databases).
